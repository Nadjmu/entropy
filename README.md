# Entropy as the effective number of internal independent degrees of freedom 
My most recent understanding of entropy and the logarithm log(A) in general is as the effective number of internal independent degrees of freedom of the multiplicative structure that is A. This tool calculates the entropy of many well-known distributions depending on their parameters that uniquely define them. The goal is to get an intuitive understanding of the direction of entropy given the internal independent degrees of freedom of the distribution which are manifested in its parameters.
